Progress: 

-We were able to have a core set of endpoints to have the
platform function as we had envisioned. Users are able to match/unmatch with other users, and update their profiles with information like
interests, age, and gender. 

-Interface gives users option to:
    -Fetch/update matches
    -Fetch/accept/send/delete friend requests
    -Match/Unmatch users
    -

-Each endpoint has a test to ensure they worked as intended. Various
types of tests were worked with (fixtures, false positives, etc)

-We were also able to connect our DB to MongoDB on cloud towards the 
second half of last semester. 

-We left off the semester upgrading our PythonAnywhere accounts to 
support running our repo on their console. 

-Established a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to streamline development workflows and ensure smooth deployments of new features.


--------------------------------

Goals for this semester: 

-Although we have the core set of endpoints for our platform,
we'd like to incorporate endpoints to improve user options. Specfically, and endpoint that can give users more filtering options for matching with friend requests they recieve. Perhaps a user wants to only accept requests with users that have a certain hobby, or age group. An endpoint can be formed that'll allow users to filter through the requests based on a criteria. We want to keep up the same pace we had last semester of gradually adding more endpoints to make sure there's enough time for testing. 

-To add on to creating more endpoints, we're sure a lot more ideas will pop up as we begin developing the frontend and think of more ways users will want to engage with the platform.

-Last semester we kept running into the issue of MongoDB not working for 
our PythonAnwhere, so we're hoping to get that resolved this semester.  

-Getting good with React and developing exprience with connecting the backend to the frontend segment of this course. All of us on the team are relatively new to React, so it'll be a learning experience for us all. Since we're all new to React, we plan on doing a bit more of peer programming this semester. Although the course is remote, we have the opportunity to meet in person this semester, so we do plan on taking advantage of this. 

-Explore the integration of real-time communication features, such as instant messaging or notifications, to facilitate immediate interaction between users and enhance engagement on the platform.
