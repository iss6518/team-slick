The txt requirement files serve as a dependency management tool within Python projects. I was once debugging an issue regarding libraries I didn't know I was missing, and ended up finding a solution with the following command: 

pip install -r requirements.txt 

It's good to keep this in mind as we expand our project. Keeping this updated can ensure others also avoid build errors!
