Implementation for Rideshare main points:

Functionalities needed: 
    -user registration (login/authentication)

    -drivers creating new ride listings 

    -making payments. Pricing for rides may be better off being decided by the driver for the early phase 

    -Messaging platform for drivers to connect with passengers 

    -mapping services to show routes

    -keeping track of unreserved seats to avoid overbooking on vehicles 

Database would be needed to keep a record of all trips created, especially since a lot of bookings will remain active for days at a time until the day of the trip.
