Design concept:

General Requirements--

	-Login: Prompts users to login to their account or make one.

	-Dashboard: After logging in, users will be greeted with a dashboard displaying the contents of their fridge, upcoming expiration dates, and suggestions for recipes based on available ingredients.

	-Fridge Contents: Users can manually add items to their virtual fridge by entering item names, quantities, and expiration dates. They can also use barcode scanning or image recognition to automatically add items.

	-Grocery List: The system generates a grocery list based on the items in the fridge, their quantities, and the user's historical shopping preferences. Users can edit this list before confirming it.

	-Expiry Alerts: The system sends notifications to users as items in their fridge approach their expiration dates, helping them plan meals accordingly.

	-Recipe Suggestions: Users can search for recipes based on the ingredients they have in their fridge. The system can suggest recipes and provide links to detailed instructions.

Backend Components to Consider--

	-Algorithm for Grocery List Generation: Develop an algorithm that considers the items in the fridge, their quantities, and user preferences to generate a dynamic grocery list.

	-Expiration Date Tracking: Implement logic to track expiration dates and send timely notifications to users.

	-Barcode Scanning: Integrate a barcode scanning API to allow users to scan product barcodes to add items to their fridge.

	-Image Recognition: Use image recognition APIs to identify items from photos users upload and add them to the fridge.

	-Notifications: Mobile push notification system to alert users about expiration dates and changes to their grocery lists.
