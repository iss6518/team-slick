Potential Ideas:
Grocery sale - Similar to “TooGoodToGo”, we can target minimizing food wastes with restaurants in NYC. This one is a bit tricky since there are arguments both for and against this. This app pretty much allows restaurants to give away food bundles at a heavily discounted rate once they reach closing times. This goes around the loophole of giving away free food after closing hours, which comes with the risk of lawsuits if people get sick. Perhaps we can spin this around but instead of restaurants we consider groceries? Usually supermarkets but the goods about to expire up front, but having an app to see how good the deals are could be helpful 






CommonGround - A full stack web application that allows individuals to match to another like-minded artist, engineer, foodie, or finatic of any kind. Users can decide to sign up for mutual mentorship, collaboration, or a simple hang out session based on a few of their top interests. For example, if a guitarist was looking to perform at a coffee shop and wanted a singer, they’d be matched with just that on CommonGround. Another use case would be if a new NYC resident was looking to find the best restaurants in their area, they’d find a foodie interested in joining them. Finally, if someone knew Web Development very well, and was looking to learn Mobile Development in exchange for teaching their own skillset- they’d find a mentee and mentor on CommonGround! Our application is versatile and aimed to be the best platform to match like-minded individuals in this deeply disconnected world. Come join us in building community at CommonGroud.

Restaurant Reservation System - Similar to yelp, Opentable, and resy, this restaurant reservation system would allow users to browse restaurants, view menus, and make reservations. It can include features like user reviews and ratings. A potential for this can be the ability to have ‘groups’ of friends in which you can all place votes on the top places you want to go to, avoiding the struggles of picking a restaurant at 8pm.
