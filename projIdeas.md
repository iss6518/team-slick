Potential Ideas:
Grocery sale - Similar to “TooGoodToGo”, we can target minimizing food wastes with restaurants in NYC. This one is a bit tricky since there are arguments both for and against this. This app pretty much allows restaurants to give away food bundles at a heavily discounted rate once they reach closing times. This goes around the loophole of giving away free food after closing hours, which comes with the risk of lawsuits if people get sick. Perhaps we can spin this around but instead of restaurants we consider groceries? Usually supermarkets but the goods about to expire up front, but having an app to see how good the deals are could be helpful
